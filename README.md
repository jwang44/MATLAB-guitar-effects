# MATLAB-guitar-effects
Some interactive matlab code, simulating the sound effect of some popular guitar pedals.

## Introduction
Using some simple signal processing algorithms to process a given audio file. 
Three audio files (.wav) are already provided in this repository. I synthesized them using GuitarPro. 
You can also process your own audio files, just put them in and tweak the code a little bit. I'm sure that's easy enough.
Four effects are provided: distortion, tremolo, delay and compression. 
You can process an audio file with each of the four effects.

## Running the code
To play with the code, simply put all these files in the same directory and open it in MATLAB. Run each of the files whose 
name ends with "test.m", e.g. "delay_test.m". While running the code, information will show in the command window and ask you to 
input relevant parameters. 

Have fun :D
